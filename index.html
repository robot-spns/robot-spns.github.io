              Proprioception is the "sixth sense" that detects limb postures with motor neurons. It requires a natural
              integration between the musculoskeletal systems and sensory receptors, which is challenging among modern
              robots that aim for lightweight, adaptive, and sensitive designs at low costs in mechanical design and
              algorithmic computation. Here, we present the Soft Polyhedral Network with an embedded vision for physical
              interactions, capable of adaptive kinesthesia and viscoelastic proprioception by learning kinetic
              features. This design enables passive adaptations to omni-directional interactions, visually captured by a
              miniature high-speed motion tracking system embedded inside for proprioceptive learning. The results show
              that the soft network can infer real-time 6D forces and torques with accuracies of 0.25/0.24/0.35 N and
              0.025/0.034/0.006 Nm in dynamic interactions. We also incorporate viscoelasticity in proprioception during
              static adaptation by adding a creep and relaxation modifier to refine the predicted results. The proposed
              soft network combines simplicity in design, omni-adaptation, and proprioceptive sensing with high
              accuracy, making it a versatile solution for robotics at a low material cost with more than 1 million use
              cycles for tasks such as sensitive and competitive grasping and touch-based geometry reconstruction. This
              study offers new insights into vision-based proprioception for soft robots in adaptive grasping, soft
              manipulation, and human-robot interaction.

              A polyhedron is generally understood as a solid geometry in three-dimensional space, featuring polygonal
              faces connected by straight edges, including prisms, pyramids, and platonic solids. Inspired by recent
              developments in soft robotics, we propose a generic design method by turning all edges of a polyhedron
              into beam structures made from soft materials, then adding layers inside to form a network, followed by
              redesigning the ends of all mid-layer edges as flexure joints to reduce inferences during deformation
              while providing sufficient structural support in a compliant manner. The resultant designs exhibit
              excellent adaptations in 3D, formulating a class of Soft Polyhedral Networks. In this study, we chose the
              pyramid shape as the base design and modified it with two vertices on top.

              We embedded a miniature motion-tracking system inside the Soft Polyhedral Network to mimic proprioception.
              The system involves a high-speed camera of up to 330 frames per second (manually adjustable lens, Chengyue
              WX605 from Weixinshijie) with a large viewing angle (170°) fixed on a mounting base inside the network and
              a plate attached to the network's first layer with a fiducial marker (ArUco of 16 mm width) stuck to its
              bottom. The camera is connected to a laptop via a USB cable, which processes the streamed images. The soft
              network's spatial adaptation is expressed by its structural compliance, then filtered by the fiducial
              marker's spatial movement inside, next captured by the high-speed camera as image features, and finally
              encoded as a time series of dimensionally reduced 6D pose vector $\mathbf{D}_t = (D_x, D_y, D_z, D_{rx},
              D_{ry}, D_{rz})_t$, namely, the translation and rotation of the marker relative to its initial pose $p_0$
              before any deformation. The focal distance was manually adjusted and fixed such that the marker was in
              focus at around 45 mm. We converted the captured RGB image to a gray image and applied an average filter
              of a 5x5 kernel to smooth the image before feeding it to the ArUco detection module in OpenCV to detect
              the pose of the fiducial marker.

              We adopt the motion tracking solution for its simplicity, transferability, and low cost in mechanical
              design and algorithmic computation for benchmarking purposes. For example, the motion tracking solution
              can be easily transferred to Soft Polyhedral Networks other than the pyramid shapes, including the prism
              and platonic ones. One can easily mount the Soft Polyhedral Networks on standard grippers by replacing
              their current rigid fingertips. The system proposed in this study involves only three components: the Soft
              Polyhedral Network, a miniature high-speed camera, and a pair of base frame and mounting base for
              fixturing. Simplicity in design is the enabling factor of the proposed Soft Polyhedral Network, supporting
              its robust adaptation with vision-based tactile sensing for robotic manipulation.

          <div class="content has-text-justified">
            <p>
              Viscoelasticity describes a material's characteristic of acting like a solid and a fluid, which is
              universally applicable to robots made from soft matter. The metamaterial design and use of polyurethane
              for fabrication make the Soft Polyhedral Network responsive to adaptation in a time-dependent and
              rate-dependent manner. Mechanical characterization of viscoelastic behaviors can be categorized into
              static and dynamic tests. Static viscoelasticity describes the material's response to a constant loading,
              including time-changing force resulting from a constant deformation (relaxation) and time-changing
              deformation resulting from a constant load (creep) over a period. Dynamic viscoelasticity describes the
              material's response to cyclic or varying loading. In robotic manipulation tasks, the proposed soft gripper
              undergoes varying loading while closing its fingers and a constant load/deformation while holding the
              grasped object. Hence, static and dynamic viscoelasticity need to be considered in real robotic
              applications. In this section, we formulate the analytical models of static viscoelasticity using the
              Wiechert model for relaxation and the Kelvin model for creep.

              We model the stress relaxation process using a Wiechert model, composed of an elastic spring of stiffness

              Voigt elements. Each Voigt element consists of a Hookean spring of stiffness $1/m$ parallel to a Newtonian
              dashpot of viscosity $1/\varphi$, resulting in a characteristic time $\tau=m/\varphi$.

              To characterize the static behavior of viscoelasticity, we set up a experiment by mounting the soft
              network on a vibration isolation table with a 6-axis force/torque sensor (Nano25 from ATI) in between. A
              3D-printed, 5 mm thick, flat probe installed on the tool flange of a robot arm (UR10e from Universal
              Robots) was used to horizontally compress the soft network's primary interaction face to a
              certain depth $D_x$ and held the compression for 300 s. We recorded the marker pose and force/torque
              readings at 30 Hz during the compression. We conducted the compression to three different depths. We found
              the best-fitting Wiechert model using the least squares method. Such relaxation response characterizes the
              soft network's viscoelastic behavior, demonstrating adaptations at both geometric and molecular levels.
              The equilibrium modulus $K_{rel}(\infty)$ drops by 27$\%$ compared to the initial modulus $K_{rel}(0)$.
              This result indicates that for grasping tasks where the fingers must constantly hold the object,
              especially when the fingers are made from soft materials, the grasp planning algorithm should anticipate a
              diminishing gripping force due to viscoelastic relaxation to avoid dropping.

              Creep occurs in scenarios of weight compensation while holding an object, which usually occurs on the
              network's secondary interaction face while holding an object. We placed a cylindrical rod of a 15 mm
              radius at the center of the network's secondary interaction face. The soft network was tilted at $\gamma =
              8^\circ$ to keep the secondary interaction face horizontal as the contact begins. By attaching different
              weights to the cylindrical rod, we tested its viscoelastic responses to small, medium, and large static
              forces of $F_y$ at 1.5, 3, and 5.9 N. We also found the best-fitting Kelvin model using the least squares
              method. The equilibrium compliance $C_{crp}(\infty)$ increased by a significant 37$\%$ compared to the
              initial compliance $C_{crp}(0)$. One can view creep as a reciprocal effect of relaxation. Both
              characterize the viscoelastic behavior of the network's molecular adaptation during static interaction.
              The experimental results agree well with the fact that the relaxation response is faster than creep.

              Dedicating the full analytical model for dynamic viscoelasticity is challenging, unlike static behavior.
              Based on findings on the viscoelasticity of the Soft Polyhedral Network, we propose a visual force
              learning method to achieve viscoelastic proprioception by incorporating the fiducial marker's kinetic
              motions representing the deformation rate. The marker inside the network works like a physical encoder to
              convert passive, spatial deformations into a 6D pose vector $\mathbf{D}_t$, tracked by the miniature
              motion tracking system inside the Soft Polyhedral Network with much reduced computational complexity.
              Then, we developed a decoder model using Multi-layered Perceptrons (MLP) to infer the corresponding 6D
              forces and torques ($F_x$, $F_y$, $F_z$, $T_x$, $T_y$, $T_z$) as the output. To reflect the speed of
              interaction during physical contact, we added a velocity term $\dot{\mathbf{D}}_t=\delta
              \mathbf{D}_t/\delta t$ to the model input by setting $\delta t$ = 15 ms (or five frames per interval at
              330 fps) for a stable tracking. The MLP model has an input layer of 12 neurons, followed by three hidden
              layers with 1,000, 100, and 50 neurons, respectively, and an output layer of 6 neurons.

              The simplicity of design enabled us to collect 140,000 samples within 10 minutes by manually interacting
              with the Soft Polyhedral Network at different heights and speeds. We collected 80,000 samples for training
              and 60,000 for testing, including the frame-by-frame raw images, recognized marker poses, 6D forces and
              torques from the ATI sensor as the true labels, and the corresponding timestamps. The dataset's maximum 6D
              forces and torques are 20 N, 20 N, 10 N, 2 Nm, 2 Nm, and 0.5 Nm, respectively.

              the only input, the model's mean absolute errors are 0.51 / 0.46 / 0.43 N ($F_x/F_y/F_z$) in forces and
              0.049 / 0.062 / 0.01 Nm ($T_x/T_y/T_z$) in torques. However, after adding deformation rate
              $\dot{\mathbf{D}}_t$ to the input features, the prediction errors are reduced by almost half to 0.25 /
              0.24 / 0.35 N in forces and 0.025 / 0.034 / 0.006 Nm in torques. The minor improvement in $F_z$ could be
              caused by the soft network's relatively less adaptiveness along the $z$-axis by design. Further adding
              deformation acceleration $\dot{\mathbf{D}}_t$ to the input features leads to a slight improvement in
              performance, suggesting that the ($\mathbf{D}_t, \dot{\mathbf{D}}_t$) inputs are sufficiently effective to
              achieve enhanced visual force learning for viscoelastic proprioception.

              We conducted a series of unidirectional compression experiments to estimate the stiffness distribution of
              the Soft Polyhedral Network defined as force over displacement. The soft finger is mounted on a
              high-performance force/torque sensor (Nano25 from ATI) on top of a custom test rig with two motorized
              linear motions and one manually driven rotary motion. The force/torque sensor has a resolution of 1/48 N
              for $F_x/F_y$, 1/16 N for $F_z$, 0.76 Nmm for $T_x/T_y$, and 0.38 Nmm for $T_z$. A probe compressed the
              Soft Polyhedral Network horizontally at 3 mm/s to a pre-defined depth of 15 mm. We conducted the
              experiments at three different pushing angles ($\alpha_0$, $\alpha_1$, and $\alpha_2$), where $\alpha_0$ =
              0° is to compress the primary interaction face, $\alpha_1$ = 45° is to compress the edge
              between the primary and secondary interaction faces, and $\alpha_2$ = 90° is to compress the
              secondary interaction face. Meanwhile, we also adjust the compression height between $H_1$ and $H_4$. The
              push displacement $\delta$ and reaction force $F$ were recorded to calculate the corresponding stiffness
              $k = F/\delta$.

              We used linear elastic elements and non-linear geometry in the FEM (Finite Element Method) simulations to
              model the large adaptive deformation. Calibrated to match the experimental stiffness measurement, the FEM
              simulation used Young's modulus of 12.05 MPa, Poisson ratio of 0.5, and density of 11.3 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. 
              The solid elements in FEM are 10-node quadratic tetrahedrons with hybrid formulation (C3D10H). The plate
              for the fiducial marker is a rigid body with a high Young's modulus of 2,600 MPa. The Soft Polyhedral
              Network's bottom is fixed. A total of about 13,000 elements were used in the simulation. The stiffness
              distribution calculated with simulated data agrees well with the actual measurement, demonstrating a good
              match between the simulation and the actual experiments. Both measurements share a similar trend where a
              U-shape stiffness distribution suggests that the primary interaction face is highly adaptive with a
              conforming geometry during physical interaction. A decreasing stiffness distribution suggests that the
              edge and secondary interaction faces are moderately adaptive.

              We investigated the soft network's passive adaptation by placing a 3D-printed roller of 7 mm in diameter
              with different weights (380$\sim$1,140 g) at various locations of the primary interaction face along the
              horizontal direction. The roller, supported by a ball bearing on each end, always rolled toward an
              equilibrium area to a complete stop. During the process, the Soft Polyhedral Network started deforming at
              the point of contact with a tendency to enclose the roller. This tendency generates an equilibrium area
              with the highest bending curvature between $L_2$ and $L_4$, causing the roller to rotate towards the
              lowest point until an equilibrium state. The resultant spatial compliance is mechanically adaptive to
              external loading, which we call "adaptive kinesthesia" of the Soft Polyhedral Network. Here, we define an
              adaptive factor $\kappa$ to measure adaptive kinesthesia under an external force $f$ exerted at location
              $l$ along the primary interaction face $S_i$ as

              where $D_{max}$ is the maximum displacement of the adaptive deformation, $l'$ is the location of maximum
              displacement, and $D_{tip}$ is the tip displacement. The adaptive factor $\kappa$ reflects how well the
              network encloses objects along the primary interaction face, with a higher value indicating a better
              adaption. The segment towards the tip of the network is not as adaptive as the middle but behaves more
              like a rigid fingernail, which is desirable to produce a firm grasp. The high stiffness at the tip leads
              to greater adaptive compliance for the pyramid design of the soft network.

              Kinesthesia is appreciated as the ability to detect active or passive limb movements about a joint, which
              corresponds to the detection and reproduction of structural movement in the Soft Polyhedral Network during
              spatial interactions. We propose a Sim2Real learning strategy to detect and reproduce the Soft Polyhedral
              Network's adaptive kinesthesia, i.e., the passive proprioception of whole-body movement, using the
              embedded miniature camera for sensing and FEM data for training. The geometry of the simulated soft
              network is represented by a collection of 26 feature points.

              The average positional error grows as the soft network exhibits large-scale deformations during physical
              interactions, ranging from 0.4 to less than 4 mm, with an overall average of 1.18 mm. We made real-time
              predictions of its whole-body movement during physical interactions, demonstrating the power of Sim2Real
              learning of the soft network's proprioception in adaptive kinesthesia enhanced by machine learning with
              FEM.
